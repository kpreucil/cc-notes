   <h2>Array Methods</h2>
   <h4>Push</h4>
    <p>Push adds an element to the end of an array</p>
    <h4>Pop</h4>
    <p>Pop returns and removes the last element of an array. I will store it wherever we tell it to. If we just call arr.pop without assigning it a variable the 'popped' element gets tossed out.</p>
    <p>Pop removes from the end of an array.</p>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">link </a>to good example</p>
    <h4>Shift</h4>
    <p>Shift is like pop, but rather than removing the last element from an array, shift removes the first.</p>
    <h4>Un-Shift</h4>
    <p>Adds to the front of an array (basically opposite of push)</p>
    <h4>Index Of</h4>
    <p>Index of tells us where the element is located in an array</p>
    <h5>Good to know. Quirk of index. -1 means that the element does not exist</h5>
    <h4>Splice</h4>
    <p>When splicing we are taking out an element at the splice location. Commonly used to remove an element in the middle of an array. (and/or replace it with something else) The delete count can be 0. After the start # and deleteCount # (if you continue making a comma everything after the first two it's optional. these extra mean that we will add in this element)</p>
    <h4>Slice</h4>
    <p>arr.slice creates a new array. it is non-destructive because it just copies the elements in an array into a new one. Good way to make a copy of the array.</p>
    <h4>Sort</h4>
    <p>Will sort your array elements into numerical and alphabetical order.</p>
    <h4>Reverse</h4>
    <p>Will sort your array into the numerical and alphabetical order reversed. However, sometimes reversed will apply to the array even if you don't tell it too? IDK that seems weird but more later apparently.</p>
    <h4>Join</h4>
    <p>takes an array and returns a string</p>
    <h4>Split</h4>
    <p>breaks a string up into an array</p>
