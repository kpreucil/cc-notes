<!--Week 1-->
Best way to use Bootstrap:
Bootstrap CDN
<!--Means that we can hotlink the files. Speeds up downloading because we do not need to serve up that large file each time ourselves-->

Uses a 12 column layout. <!--whatever column you use must add up to 12. If it goes over it will wrap-->
    col-xs-1 <!--can have 12 in a row -->

        col = column
        xs = screen size
        # = amount of columns viewed on that screen size

    Column Sizes:
        col-xs-?
        col-sm-?
        col-md-? <!--might be a tablet size?-->
        col-lg-?
        col-xl-?

Avoid putting a row inside of a row.
